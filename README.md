# Coding Portfolio – Laya Obaid

Welcome to my coding portfolio! This repository contains my coding projects
built throughout high school as I learn web development, programming, and software engineering.

## Purpose

The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my skills, progress, and growth
in multiple programming languages, as well as my commitment to learning
and building projects that are organized, functional, and creative.  
This portfolio also serves as a demonstration of my abilities for potential
college applications, internships, and STEM opportunities, including programs like NASA.

## Languages & Project Folders

- **HTML / CSS** – Websites and styling projects  
- **JavaScript** – Interactive websites and dynamic features  
- **Python** – Logic, problem-solving, and data-focused projects  
- **C** – Low-level programming and procedural projects  
- **C++** – Object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms  

## Future Goals

- Add more projects for each language as I learn  
- Include small portfolio websites for major projects  
- Continue building my skills for college applications and future internships
